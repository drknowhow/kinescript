# Changelog

## 1.0.0 (2026-10-29)

First release.

- Scenes as JSON: layers, keyframes, tweens, AST-checked expressions, OKLab colour blending.
- Cue timing: `"at": "title.out+0.2"`, markers, group-relative times, cycle and missing-id errors.
- Layer types: shapes, SVG paths, arrows, text with per-unit motion, counters, images, video with trim, speed,
  loop and punch-in zoom, captions from SRT/VTT, SkSL shaders, groups and cut-list sequences.
- Motion presets including `snap` for hard cuts; shader presets `mesh`, `aurora`, `grid` and `score`.
- Components: `lowerThird`, `titleCard`, `callout`, `focus`, `progress`, `kinetic`, and user components.
- GPU rendering through Skia with a CPU fallback; frames split across processes and joined without re-encoding.
- Outputs: MP4, ProRes 4444 and VP9 with alpha, GIF, PNG sequences, with an audio mix.
- Agent tools: `kine check`, `kine look`, `kine probe`, `kine docs`, and an MCP server (`kine mcp`).
- Bundled fonts: Space Grotesk and IBM Plex Mono (SIL OFL 1.1).
