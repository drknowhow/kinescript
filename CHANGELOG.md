# Changelog

## Unreleased

- `kine check` validates every key against the schema, names the intended key first, and lists
  every problem at once with its layer and field. Synonyms from other tools, CSS gradients,
  Shadertoy and GLSL shaders, comments and trailing commas in JSON are read and noted.
- Missing media and trims past the end of a clip fail before rendering, with nearby file names.
- `kine docs` rewritten for small models: rules, a complete scene, every default, recipes.
- Fixed: a text frame could depend on earlier frames when weight was animated.
- Fixed: transparent .mov/.webm had dark fringes (premultiplied pixels sent as straight alpha).
- Fixed: odd output sizes crashed MP4 encoding.
- Fixed: the contrast check skipped text and counters that used the default colour.
- A contrast warning names the shape behind the text and says to move the text clear of it.
- The bar chart recipe adds a label under the baseline, anchored at its top edge.
- Video decodes at source size on a prefetch thread (single worker on `edit.json`: 34 to 60 fps).
- GIFs render at a 720 px long side, 15 fps, 128 colours: on examples/hello.json, 0.78 MB in 1.1 s against 1.22 MB in 2.4 s before.
- `kine still --at end` and negative times; `kine probe clip.mp4`; render results include w and h.
- `look --boxes` labels only top-level layers, outside their boxes.

## 1.0.0 (2026-10-29)

First release.

- Scenes as JSON: layers, keyframes, tweens, AST-checked expressions, OKLab colour blending.
- Cue timing: `"at": "title.out+0.2"`, markers, group-relative times, cycle and missing-id errors.
- Layer types: shapes, SVG paths, arrows, text with per-unit motion, counters, images, video with trim, speed,
  loop and punch-in zoom, captions from SRT/VTT, SkSL shaders, groups and cut-list sequences.
- Motion presets including `snap` for hard cuts; shader presets `mesh`, `aurora`, `grid` and `score`.
- Components: `lowerThird`, `titleCard`, `callout`, `focus`, `progress`, `kinetic`, and user components.
- GPU rendering through Skia with a CPU fallback; frames split across processes and joined without re-encoding.
- Outputs: MP4, ProRes 4444 and VP9 with alpha, GIF, PNG sequences, with an audio mix.
- Agent tools: `kine check`, `kine look`, `kine probe`, `kine docs`, and an MCP server (`kine mcp`).
- Bundled fonts: Space Grotesk and IBM Plex Mono (SIL OFL 1.1).
